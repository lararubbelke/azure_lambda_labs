## Overview ##

Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data. It works across on-premises and cloud data sources and SaaS to ingest, prepare, transform, analyze, and publish your data.

Transformation activities in Azure Data Factory transform and process your raw data into predictions and insights. The transformation activity executes in a computing environment such as Azure HDInsight cluster or an Azure Batch. You will create an Azure HDInsight Hive activity to execute a Hive query.

Azure SQL Data Warehouse is an enterprise-class, distributed database capable of processing massive volumes of relational and non-relational data. It's the industry's first cloud data warehouse that combines proven SQL capabilities with the ability to grow, shrink, and pause in seconds. SQL Data Warehouse is also deeply ingrained into Azure, and you'll use Data Factory to move generated statistics into SQL Data Warehouse and visualize it in Power BI.

In this module, you'll use Data Factory to compose services into managed data flow pipelines to transform the data ingested from the Parts Unlimited logs into meaningful data to be visualized using Power BI.

<a name="Setup"></a>
### Setup ###
In order to run the exercises in this module, you'll need to create an HDI cluster, a SQL Data Warehouse, a storage account and upload some asset files. You can either follow the Auto Setup or the Manual Setup steps listed below. If this is the first time you're working with these services, we highly recommend you go through the Manual Setup process.  

> **Important:** when entering the names for the storage account, SQL DW server and HDInsight server, those must be **globally unique**. To ensure this, you can use your first and last name as prefixes for the resource names. For instance: "johndoestorage", "johndoehdi" and "johndoesqlserver".

<a name="AutoSetup"> </a>
#### Auto Setup #####
Navigate to the Setup Folder under 'Module 2'. You will find a folder called as Initial Setup. If you are using Azure Powershell, go into the folder named 'ps'. If you're using the Azure CLI, navigate to the 'cli' folder. Now, execute the **setup** file.

You will be prompted for the following information:

1. Login credentials for Microsoft Azure
1. Resource Group Name you'd like to use for the lab 

<a name="ManualSetupUploadFiles"></a>
#### Manual Setup 1: Manually uploading the sample files ####

In this section you will create a new storage account, and load sample data that will be used later in the module. 

1. Navigate to azure_lambda_labs\Module2-GainInsights\Setup and open the createStorage_uploadFiles.ps1 to edit.  
	1. Update the $HDInsightFolder variable with the local path where you stored the sample log files for the HDInsight lab.  
	1. Update the $dwdataFolder variable with the local path where you stored the sample log files for the ADW lab.  
	1. Save the changes.
1. Execute the PowerShell script.  
1. When prompted, input a globally unique name for the Resource Group. Remember the name of the resoruce group, you will use this same resource group when creating the HDI cluster, SQL Data Warehouse and Data Factory.
1. When prompted, input a globally unique name for the Storage Account.

1. In the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), create a new Storage Account.
 1. Provide a globally unique name for the new storage account. 
 1. Select "_Resource Manager_" for the deployment model.
 1. Select the "_Standard Locally Redundant_" (Standard-LRS) storage account type.  
	 	>**Note:** Under normal circumstances, you may choose to replicate across regions to support recovery scenarios.  This lab will not require geo-redundency. 

1. When the storage account has been provisioned and the files are uploaded, open the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to copy the storage account access key.
	1. Navigate to All Resources and type the name of your storage account in the Filter items box.  
	1. Click on the storage account.
	1. Select Access Keys from the Settings blade to copy the storage account key.  
	> **Note:** You will use the storage key in several steps during this lab. **Copy this to a text file and save in a readily accessible location (ie Desktop).**

	![Getting account name and key](Images/setup-storage-key.png?raw=true "Getting account name and key")

	_Getting account name and key_


1. Open **Azure Storage Explorer** or the tool of your preference to connect to the new storage account using the account name and key from the previous step. 
	1. On the left pane of _Azure Storage Explorer_, right-click on **Storage Accounts** and select **Connect to Azure Storage...** 
	1. Enter the account name and key in the dialog, then click **OK**.

	> _Settings_

	> ![Add an Account](Images/azure-storage-explorer-add-account.png?raw=true "Add an Account")

	> _Add an Account_

1. Verify the three new Blob Containers exist. 
	1. In _Azure Storage Explorer_ expand your account and expand **Blob Containers** to verify containers with the name **partsunlimited**, **processeddata**, and "**dwdata**"

You should now have sample data and a new storage account with three blob containers. 

- The partsunlimited blob container should contain the raw logs data and scripts folders. 
- The processeddata container should be empty, as it will be populated during the Azure Data Factory lab.  
- The dwdata container should have the processedlogs sample data, which will be used during the Azure Data Warehouse lab.

	![Create HDI cluster](Images/setup-create-hdi.png?raw=true "Create HDI cluster")

	_Create HDI cluster_

> **Note:** For this module we don't need to persist the cluster when deleted, so we won't configure a Hive and Oozie metastore. 

> Using the metastore helps you to retain your Hive and Oozie metadata, so that you don't need to re-create Hive tables or Oozie jobs when you create a new cluster. By default, Hive uses an embedded Azure SQL database to store this information. The embedded database can't preserve the metadata when the cluster is deleted.

> In order to configure Oozie or Hive metadata Database, first you need to create the SQL Database. To do this, navigate to _New > Data + Storage > SQL Database_ and create a _blank database_ in the same resource group that you want to use for the HDI cluster.

> ![Create a SQL Database](Images/creating-the-sql-database.png?raw=true "Create a SQL Database")

## Exercises ##
This module includes the following exercises:

1. [Creating Hive code to do analytics on your data](#Exercise1)
1. [Loading and querying data in Azure SQL Data Warehouse](#Exercise2)
1. [Creating Azure Data Factory](#Exercise3)
1. [Orchestrating Azure Data Factory workflow](#Exercise4)
1. [Using the data in the warehouse to generate Power BI visualizations](#Exercise5)

Estimated time to complete this module: **60 minutes**

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Creating Hive code to do analytics on your data ###

**HDInsight** is a cloud implementation on **Microsoft Azure** of the rapidly expanding **Apache Hadoop** technology stack that is the go-to solution for big data analysis.

**Apache Hive** is a data warehouse system for Hadoop, which enables data summarization, querying, and analysis of data by using **HiveQL** (a query language similar to SQL). Hive can be used to interactively explore your data or to create reusable batch processing jobs.

This exercise is meant to be an extension of Module 1. We will be using the data that was spooled by Azure Stream Analytics to Azure Blob Storage to perform our queries. However, to maintain the modularity 
In this exercise, you'll create a **Hive activity** using HQL script code to generate the output data in the Azure Storage.

<a name="Ex1Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Writing a Hive query to analyze the logs ####

In this task, you'll write a Hive query to generate product stats (views and cart additions) from the Parts Unlimited logs.

1. Navigate to the HDInsight server dashboard and click on the URL: https://**{clusterName}**.azurehdinsight.net/

1. You will be directed to the Ambari portal. Once there, follow the steps below:

	1. Select the **Hive view** in the views button at the top bar.

		![Hive view option in Ambari](Images/ex2task1-ambari-hive-option.png?raw=true "Hive view option in Ambari")

		_Hive view option in Ambari_

	1. In the new worksheet, write HQL code to create a partitioned table for the existing blobs and then parse the JSON format. Paste the snippet below, replace  **<****StorageAccountName****>** and update the partition to be of a valid **date** and **location** (where the input logs were uploaded according to the current date):

		````SQL
		CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS LogsRaw (jsonentry string) 
		PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT, day INT)
		STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION "wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/"

		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=<year>, month=<month>, day=<firstDay>) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/<year>/<month>/<firstDay>';
		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=<year>, month=<month>, day=<secondDay>) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/<year>/<month>/<secondDay>';
		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=<year>, month=<month>, day=<thirdDay>) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/<year>/<month>/<thirdDay>';
		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=<year>, month=<month>, day=<fourthDay>) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/<year>/<month>/<fourthDay>';
		````

		> **Note**: The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command that we used here, creates an external table, the data file can be located outside the default container and does not move the data file.

		![Hive editor](Images/ex2task1-ambari-hive-editor2.png?raw=true "Hive editor")

		_Hive editor_

	1. Click **Execute** to run the query.

	1. Wait for the status to be Succeeded, select the results tab in the "Query Process Results" panel to show the values.

		![Query output](Images/ex2task1-ambari-query-output.png?raw=true "Query output")

		_Query output_

	> **Note:** Ambari portal offers many features. You can create advanced visualization of the data results using charts, customize the Hive settings, create customized views, among many other options. To learn more about Ambari portal go to [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Ambari Web UI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari/).

1. Write a new Hive query to create the output partitioned table using a columns schema matching the output of the previous query. Paste the snippet below and replace the **StorageAccountName** placeholder.

	````SQL
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS websiteActivity (
		eventdate string,
		userid string,
		type string,
		productid string,
		quantity int,
		price double
	) PARTITIONED BY (year int, month int, day int) 
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION 'wasb://processeddata@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/structuredlogs';
	````

1. **Submit** or **execute** the Hive query to create the output table.

<a name="Ex1Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Create the HQL for your data ####

In this task, we'll create our hive scripts to process out data. This is used to demonstrate the ability of Hadoop to parse nested JSONs easily.

1. Open the file located in **Setup\Assets\HDInsight\Scripts\structuredlogs.hql** and review its content:

	````SQL
	INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE websiteActivity Partition (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day})
	SELECT CAST(CONCAT(split(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.eventDate"),'T')[0], ' ', SUBSTRING(split(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.eventDate"),'T')[1],0,LENGTH(split(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.eventDate"),'T')[1])-1)) as TIMESTAMP) as eventdate,
		 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.userId") as userid,
         get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.type") as type,
         get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productId") as productid,
		 CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.quantity") as int) as quantity,
         CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.price") as DOUBLE) as price
	FROM LogsRaw
	WHERE year=${hiveconf:Year} and month=${hiveconf:Month} and day=${hiveconf:Day};
	````

    Notice this script is, essentially, the Hive query you wrote and tested in the previous task but it insert the results in the output table.

1. Open the file located in **Setup\Assets\HDInsight\Scripts\addpartitions.hql** and review its content:

	````SQL

	ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day}) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@${hiveconf:StorageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/logs/${hiveconf:Year}/${hiveconf:Month}/${hiveconf:Day}';

	ALTER TABLE websiteActivity ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day}) LOCATION 'wasb://processeddata@${hiveconf:StorageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/structuredlogs/${hiveconf:Year}/${hiveconf:Month}/${hiveconf:Day}';
	````

    This script adds the partitiones by date to the input and output tables. The storage account name and all the required date components for the partitiones will be passed as parameters by the Hive action running in the Data Factory.


1. Open the file located in **Setup\Assets\HDInsight\Scripts\productcatalog.hql** and review its content:

	````SQL
	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS RawProductCatalog;
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE RawProductCatalog (
		jsonentry string
	) STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION "wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/productcatalog/"
	

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ProductCatalog;
	CREATE TABLE ProductCatalog ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	LOCATION 'wasbs://processeddata@<Azure storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/product_catalog/'
	AS SELECT get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.skuNumber") as skuNumber,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.id") as id,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productId") as productId,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.categoryId") as categoryId,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.category.name") as categoryName,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.title") as title,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.price") as price,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.salePrice") as salePrice,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.costPrice") as costPrice,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productArtUrl") as productArtUrl,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.description") as description,
			  get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productDetails") as productDetails
	FROM RawProductCatalog;
	````


<a name="Ex1Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 (Optional) - Create the HQL script to process the raw data ####
1. First, let's start by getting used to the simple HiveQL language. Let's run a query to compute the top-selling products for the day.

	````SQL
	SELECT productid, SUM(quantity)
	FROM websiteActivity
	WHERE eventdate = from_unixtime(unix_timestamp())
	GROUP BY productid;
	````

1. We can see how easy it is to run a SQL-like query using HiveQL. We can easily join this data to the product catalog data and understand our top selling categories as well. The HiveQL query below does exactly that.

	````SQL
	SELECT a.productid, b.title, b.categoryName, SUM(a.quantity)
	FROM websiteActivity a LEFT OUTER JOIN RawProductCatalog b
	ON a.productid = b.productid
	WHERE eventdate = from_unixtime(unix_timestamp())
	GROUP BY productid;
	````

1. Next, we'll be processing some data using HiveQL. In this scenario, we will process our log data and understand which products get bought together. This will help us understand our audience a little better and come up with better marketing strategies for our e-commerce store. This is used to highlight the ease and ability of a NoSQL ETL engine like Hadoop to work with Arrays within tabular formatted data.

The code can be found in **Setup\Assets\HDInsight\Scripts\relatedproducts.hql**

	````SQL
	DROP VIEW IF EXISTS unique_purchases;
	CREATE VIEW unique_products AS 
	SELECT distinct userid, productid
	FROM websiteActivity where eventdate > date_sub(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp()),30)
	AND type = 'checkout';

	DROP VIEW IF EXISTS all_purchased_products;
	CREATE VIEW all_purchased_products AS 
	SELECT a.userid, COLLECT_LIST(a.productid,'\;',a.qty) as product_list from
	(SELECT userid, productid, sum(quantity) as qty websiteActivity
	WHERE where eventdate > date_sub(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp()),30)
	AND type = 'checkout'
	ORDER BY userid ASC, qty DESC) a;

	DROP VIEW IF EXISTS related_purchase_list;
	CREATE VIEW related_purchases AS
	SELECT a.userid, a.productid, b.product_list
	FROM unique_purchases a LEFT OUTER JOIN all_purchased_products b ON (a.userid = b.userid);

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS related_purchases;
	CREATE TABLE related_purchases ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' LOCATION 'wasbs://processeddata@<Azure storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/related_purchases/' AS 
	SELECT a.productid, a.related_product, a.quantity, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY a.productid ORDER BY a.quantity DESC) as rank FROM
	(SELECT productid, SPLIT(product_list, '\;')[0] as related_product, CAST(SPLIT(product_list, '\;')[1] as INT) as quantity
	FROM related_purchase_list LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(product_list) prodList as product_list) a
	WHERE a.productid <> a.related_product
	GROUP BY a.productid
	ORDER BY productid ASC, rank DESC;
	````

1. Now that we have the related purchases, we can use this information to power recommendations on our e-commerce website. We can move the output of this table to a transactional data store, where our web app can pick up the latest data to power the recommendations.


1. These scripts were already uploaded to your storage during the module setup by using the manual steps or the **Setup.cmd** script. Verify the HQL script was uploaded by using the **Azure Storage Explorer** to navigate to the **Scripts** folder in the **partsunlimited** container.

	1. In the left pane navigate to the **partsunlimited** container, open the **Scripts** folder and verify the files are present.

### Exercise 2: Loading and querying data in Azure SQL Data Warehouse ###
The fastest way to import data into SQL Data Warehouse is to use **PolyBase** to load data from Azure blob storage. PolyBase uses SQL Data Warehouse's massively parallel processing (MPP) design to load data in parallel from Azure blob storage. To use PolyBase, you can use T-SQL commands or an Azure Data Factory pipeline.  This exercise will use a T-SQL command.  Later in the lab you will write an Azure Data Factory pipeline to load data with PolyBase. 

In this exercise you'll create an **External Table** using PolyBase. You will build a new SQL Data Warehouse table using the Create Table As Select (CTAS) syntax and issue a few sample queries. 

Once you have had some experience using PolyBase and querying Azure SQL Data Warehouse, you create the tables and stored procedures that will be used with Azure Data Factory later in the lab.

<a name="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Connect to Azure SQL Data Warehouse using Visual Studio 2015 ####

1. Return to the Azure Portal and navigate to the new SQL Data Warehouse you created.

1. In the _SQL Data Warehouse_ blade, click **Open in Visual Studio**. In the new blade, click **Open in Visual Studio**.

	![Open Data Warehouse in Visual Studio](Images/setup-open-vs.png?raw=true "Open Data Warehouse in Visual Studio")

	_Open Data Warehouse in Visual Studio_

1. Confirm you want to switch apps if prompted.

1. In Visual Studio, enter the SQL Server credentials (dwadmin/P@ssword123).

1. In the _SQL Server Object Explorer_, expand the server and right-click the **partsunlimited** database.   Select **New Query...**.

You have now connected to your Azure SQL Data Warehouse and are ready to begin building and loading tables.  

<a name="Ex2Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Configure Connectivity with Azure Blob Storage ####
PolyBase uses T-SQL external objects to define the location and attributes of the external data. The external object definitions are stored in SQL Data Warehouse. The data itself is stored externally in Azure Blob Storage.

All scripts for this exercise are available in the folder Module2-GainInsights\Setup\Assets\ADW\Scripts\.

1. Execute the following SQL statement in the new query window. Replace the _Azure storage key_ placeholder with your Azure storage account key. The script will create a Master Key if it doesn't already exist and create a new Database Scoped Credential. The Master Key is needed to encrypt the database scoped credentials that will connect to your storage account. 

	````SQL
	IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys where name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
	CREATE MASTER KEY;

	CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL AzureStorageCredential
	WITH
    IDENTITY = 'user',
    SECRET = '<Azure storage key>';
	````

1. Execute the following SQL statement in the new query window to create an external data source. Replace the _Azure storage account name_ placeholder with your Azure storage account name.  Note that PolyBase uses Hadoop APIs to access data in Azure blob storage.  

	````SQL
	CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE AzureStorage
	WITH (
	    TYPE = HADOOP,
	    LOCATION = 'wasbs://processeddata@<Azure storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net',
	    CREDENTIAL = AzureStorageCredential
	);
	````

1. Once you have set up connectivity, open a new query window and execute the following SQL statement to define the data format.  

	````SQL
	CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT TextFile
	WITH (
	    FORMAT_TYPE = DelimitedText,
	    FORMAT_OPTIONS (FIELD_TERMINATOR = '|')
	);
	````

#### Task 3 - Set up the external table ####
An external table contains column names and types, just like any other database table. It simply doesn't contain the data.

Now let's create the external tables. All we are doing here is defining column names and data types, and binding them to the location and format of the Azure blob storage files. The location is the folder under the root directory of the Azure Storage Blob.

1. We will create a separate schema for our external tables.

	````SQL
	CREATE SCHEMA [asb]
	GO
	````

1. Open a query window and execute the following SQL to create the external table.  Notice the WITH clause is using the data source and file format created in the previous task.
	````SQL
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE asb.WebisteActivityExternal
	(
		EventDate int,
		UserID nvarchar(20),
		Type nvarchar(20),
		ProductID nvarchar(20), 
		Quantity int, 
		Price decimal
	)
	WITH (
	    LOCATION='/structuredlogs/2016/07/',
	    DATA_SOURCE=AzureStorage,
	    FILE_FORMAT=TextFile
	);
	````

1. Let's create another table to load the Product Catalog into SQL DW so that we can perform some meaningful analytics like understanding our most profitable products the last 30 days, so that we can promote them further.

	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE asb.ProductCatalogExternal
	(
		SkuNumber nvarchar(50),
		Id int,
		ProductID nvcarchar(20),
		CategoryID nvcarchar(20),
		CategoryName nvarchar(100),
		Title nvcarchar(100),
		Price decimal,
		SalePrice decimal,
		CostPrice decimal,
		ProductArtUrl nvcarchar(max),
		Description nvcarchar(max),
		ProductDetails nvcarchar(max)
	)
	WITH (
	    LOCATION='/product_catalog/',
	    DATA_SOURCE=AzureStorage,
	    FILE_FORMAT=TextFile
	);
	````

1. Now that the external table has been created, let's run a couple of sample queries to get used to the SQL DW environment. Notice how you query the external table as you would any other table in the database.

	````SQL
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM asb.WebsiteActivityExternal;

	SELECT
		ProductID,
		SUM(CASE WHEN Type = 'view' THEN Quantity ELSE 0 END) AS ProdViews,
		SUM(CASE WHEN Type = 'add' THEN Quantity ELSE 0 END) AS ProdAdds,
		SUM(CASE WHEN Type = 'checkout' THEN Quantity ELSE 0 END) AS ProdBuys
	FROM asb.WebsiteActivityExternal
	WHERE 
	GROUP BY ProductID;
	````

#### Task 4 - Loading Data with CTAS ####
You can query data using the external tables, but often you will want to load the data in Azure Data Warehouse where you can optimize the table for query and analysis.  

The easiest and most efficient way to load data from Azure blob storage is to use [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT]. Loading with CTAS leverages the strongly typed external tables you have just created.

1. Open a new query window and execute the following to create a new schema for our internally managed tables. 

	````SQL
	CREATE SCHEMA [adw]
	GO

	````

1. Execute the following in a query window to create a new partitioned table.  Note this table will be created based on a SELECT statement issued on the external table. 

	````SQL
	IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'adw' AND TABLE_NAME = 'FactWebsiteActivity')
	CREATE TABLE adw.FactWebsiteActivity
	WITH (
		CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
		DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductID),
	    PARTITION   (   EventDate RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
	                   ( 20160704, 20160705, 20160706)
	                    )
		)
	GO

	INSERT INTO TABLE adw.FactWebsiteActivity
	SELECT
		EventDate,
		UserID,
		Type,
		ProductID, 
		Quantity, 
		Price
	FROM asb.ProductLogExternal
	WHERE Type='checkout'
	GO
	````

1. Similarly, let's pull our latest and greatest product catalog data from blob storage.

	````SQL
	IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'adw' AND TABLE_NAME = 'DimProductCatalog')
	DROP TABLE adw.DimProductCatalog
	GO

	CREATE TABLE adw.DimProductCatalog
	WITH (
		CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
		DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductID)
		)
	AS 
	SELECT
		skuNumber,
		id,
		productId,
		categoryId,
		categoryName,
		title,
		price,
		salePrice,
		costPrice,
		productArtUrl,
		description,
		productDetails
	FROM asb.ProductCatalogExternal
	GO
	````


1. Azure SQL Data Warehouse does not automatically manage your statistics.  It is a good practice to create single column statistics on your internally managed tables immediately after a load. There are some choices for statistics. For example, if you create single-column statistics on every column it might take a long time to rebuild statistics. If you know certain columns are not going to be in query predicates, you could skip creating statistics on those columns. For instance, you'll notice that we have not done statistics on the 'UserID' column, because we will not be using it for our query.

	````SQL	
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_FactWebsiteActivity_EventDate on adw.FactProductLog(EventDate);
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_FactWebsiteActivity_Type on adw.FactProductLog(Type);
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_FactWebsiteActivity_ProductID on adw.FactProductLog(ProductID);
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_FactWebsiteActivity_Quantity on adw.FactProductLog(Quantity);
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_FactWebsiteActivity_Price on adw.FactProductLog(Price);
	````

<a name="Ex2Task5"></a>
#### Task 5 - Create a new summary table for reporting ####

Before we move to the next exercise, create a stored procedure to understand our most profitable products that will be used for reporting and analysis.

1. Execute the following statement to create the summary table and table statistics.
	````SQL	

	CREATE PROCEDURE adw.asp_populate_ProfitableProducts AS
	BEGIN
	IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'adw' AND TABLE_NAME = 'ProfitableProducts')
	DROP TABLE adw.ProfitableProducts
	GO

	CREATE TABLE adw.ProfitableProducts 
	WITH
	(   
	    CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
	    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
	)
	AS
	SELECT 
		a.ProductId, 
		b.CategoryName,
		SUM(a.Price - (b.CostPrice*a.Quantity)) as Profit
	FROM adw.FactWebsiteActivity AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN adw.DimProductCatalog AS b
		ON a.ProductId = b.ProductId
	WHERE a.eventdate > DATEDIFF(day, 30, GetDate())
	GROUP BY ProductId, a.CategoryName
	ORDER BY Profit DESC, a.ProductId ASC;

	
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_ProfitableProducts_ProductId on adw.ProfitableProducts(ProductId);
	CREATE STATISTICS Stat_adw_ProfitableProducts_CategoryName on adw.ProfitableProducts(CategoryName);
	END
	GO
	````

1. Click execute button (**Ctrl+Shift+E**) to run the statement and create the stored procedure.

	![Creating schema for Data Warehouse](Images/ex2task5-create_proc.png?raw=true "Creating schema for Data Warehouse")

	_Creating schema for Data Warehouse_

1. Execute the stored procedure to create the table.  Issue a select statement on the ProfitableProducts table to verify the procedure executed correctly.

	````SQL	

	exec adw.asp_populate_ProfitableProducts; 

	SELECT * FROM adw.ProfitableProducts;

	````

### Exercise 3: Creating Azure Data Factory ###

The next exercise will walk you through automating a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory.  At the end of this section you will have a data pipeline that will process data with HDInsight, move data from HDInsight to Azure Data Warehouse, and execute a stored procedure on Azure Data Warehouse to populate a summary table on a daily schedule.  This is a canonical workload whereby you will use HDInsight for large batch processing and move data to a relational structure where it can be readily consumed by end user reporting and analysis tools. You will also be introduced to the Monitoring tool for Azure Data Factory. 

All JSON assets to create the Data Factory objects are available in _Module2-GainInsights\Setup\Assets\DataFactory_.

_Data factory key concepts_

Azure Data Factory has a few key entities that work together to define the input and output data, processing events, and the schedule and resources required to execute the desired data flow.

- **Activities**: Activities define the actions to perform on your data. Each activity takes zero or more datasets as inputs and produces one or more datasets as outputs.
- **Pipelines**: Pipelines are a logical grouping of Activities. They are used to group activities into a unit that together perform a task (i.e. clean log).
- **Datasets**: Datasets are named references/pointers to the data you want to use as an input or an output of an Activity. Datasets identify data structures within different data stores including tables, files, folders, and documents.
- **Linked service**: Linked services define the information needed for Data Factory to connect to external resources (data stores or compute resources for hosting activities execution).


![Data factory key concepts](Images/data-factory-exercises.png?raw=true "Data factory key concepts")

> **Note:** If you need to skip the manual instructions to create the data factory and provisioning of the linked services, datasets and pipelines. You can run the CreateDataFactory.cmd script to quickly provision it.


<a name="Ex3Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating the Data Factory in the Azure Portal ####

In this task, you create a data factory to orchestrate the linked services and data transformation activities.

1. On the Hub menu, select **New -> Data + Analytics -> Data Factory**.

1. Use the following values to create the new data factory:

 1. Enter a name for the data factory.  
 1. Click **Use existing** under Resource group and select the resource group you created at the start of the lab.  
 1. Make sure the **Pin to dashboard** is selected so you can have a quick access and click **Create**.

	![New data factory blade](Images/ex1task2-new-data-factory.png?raw=true "New data factory blade")

	_New data factory blade_

1. After the creation is complete, you'll find the data factory in the dashboard.

<a name="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Adding the linked services ####

In this task, you'll create the linked services.  Linked Services are essentially connections to data sources and destinations. At the end of this task you will have created the following linked services:
- Azure Storage
- HDInsight
- Azure Data Warehouse


>**Note:** It is recommended that you open a new tab and navigate to the Azure portal and use this tab to copy the keys/server names needed to create the linked services in Data Factory.


1. In the *Data Factory* blade, click **Author and deploy** tile to launch the *Editor* for the data factory.

	![Author and deploy](Images/ex1task2-author-and-deploy.png?raw=true "Author and deploy")

	_Author and deploy_

1. In the **Editor**, click **New data store** button on the toolbar and select **Azure storage** from the drop down menu. You should see the JSON template for creating an Azure storage linked service in the right pane.

	![New Azure storage data store](Images/ex1task2-new-storage.png?raw=true "New Azure storage data store")

	_New Azure storage data store_

1. Replace **<****accountname****>** and **<****accountkey****>** placeholders with the account name and key values of the Azure storage account where the Parts Unlimited logs are stored (created with Setup.cmd script or with manual steps).

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureStorage",
			  "description": "",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

    See [JSON Scripting Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=516971&clcid=0x409) for details about JSON properties.

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to deploy the **StorageLinkedService**.

	![Deploy linked service](Images/ex1task2-deploy.png?raw=true "Deploy linked service")

	_Deploy linked service_

1. Confirm that you see the message *Linked service deployed successfully* on the title bar.

	![Linked service deployed successfully](Images/ex1task2-deployed.png?raw=true "Linked service deployed successfully")

	_Linked service deployed successfully_

1. Repeat to create another service for the SQL Data Warehouse server. Click **New data store** button on the toolbar and select **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** from the drop down menu.

1. Replace placeholders in the connectionString (**<****servername****>**, **<****databasename****>**, **<****username****>** and **<****password****>**) with the setting values used when creating the SQL Data Warehouse database in setup script.

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureSqlDW",
			  "description": "",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"connectionString": "Data Source=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=partsunlimited;User ID=dwadmin@<servername>;Password=P@ssword123;Integrated Security=False;Encrypt=True;Connect Timeout=30"
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the **AzureSqlDWLinkedService**.

1. Now, click **New compute** button on the toolbar and select **HDInsight cluster** from the drop down menu. You should see the JSON template for creating the *HDInsight cluster linked service* in the right pane.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can use a [On Demand HDInsight cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-factory-compute-linked-services/#azure-hdinsight-on-demand-linked-service), but it will take around 15 minutes to create the cluster when running the Data Factory. Use this approach only if the provided cluster is not available and make sure to specify the proper password.

1. Update the setting placeholders as shown in the snippet below. Replace the **<****hdiclustername****>** placeholder with the name you used when running the **Setup.cmd** script or with manual steps.

	````JavaScript
	{
        "name": "HDInsightLinkedService",
        "properties": {
            "type": "HDInsight",
            "description": "",
            "typeProperties": {
                "clusterUri": "https://<hdiclustername>.azurehdinsight.net/",
                "userName": "admin",
                "password": "P@ssword123",
                "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService"
            }
        }
    }
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the **HDInsightLinkedService**.

	![Linked services created](Images/ex1task2-linked-services.png?raw=true "Linked services created")

	_Linked services created_

    > **Note:** if the deployment fails, it may be due to the HDI cluster is still being provisioned. Verify the status in the portal.

<a name="Ex3Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 - Creating the input and output datasets ####

In this task, you'll create the input and output tables corresponding to the linked services.

1. In the Editor for the Data Factory, click **New dataset** button on the toolbar and click **Azure Blob storage** from the drop down menu.

1. Change the **name** propety to "RawJsonData" and the **linkedServiceName** property to "AzureStorageLinkedService".

1. Remove the **structure** property. The file is in JSON format and the structure can be omitted.

1. Change the **typeProperties** to use the _/year/month/day_ partition for the blob paths.

	````JavaScript
	"typeProperties": {
		"folderPath": "partsunlimited/logs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
		"partitionedBy": 
		[
			 { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
			 { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
			 { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }
		],
		"format": {
			"type": "TextFormat"
		}
	},
	````

1. Set the availability frequency to daily.

	````JavaScript
	"availability": {
		"frequency": "Day",
		"interval": 1
	},
	````

1. Add an **external** property to the dataset and set it to **true**. This setting informs the Data Factory service that this table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

	````JavaScript
	"external": true
	````

    The final _LogJsonFromBlob_ dataset should look like the following snippet:
    
	````JavaScript
	{
		"name": "RawJsonData",
		"properties": {
			"type": "AzureBlob",
			"linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
			"typeProperties": {
				"folderPath": "partsunlimited/logs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
				"partitionedBy": 
				[
					 { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
					 { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
					 { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }
				],
				"format": {
					"type": "JsonFormat"
				}
			},
			"availability": {
				"frequency": "Day",
				"interval": 1
			},
			"external": true
		}
	}
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create the input dataset.

1. Repeat the steps to create another dataset for output with the following settings:

 1. **name**: "WebsiteActivityBlob"
 1. **linkedServiceName**: "AzureStorageLinkedService"
 1. structure (this file is structured using CSV format with the fields specified below):

		````JavaScript
		"structure": [
			{
				"name": "eventdate",
				"type": "DateTime"	
			},
			{
				"name": "userid",
				"type": "String"
			},
			{
				"name": "type",
				"type": "String"
			},
			{
				"name": "productid",
				"type": "String"
			},
			{
				"name": "quantity",
				"type": "Int32"
			},
			{
				"name": "price",
				"type": "Double"
			}
		],
		````

 1. typeProperties (the format will use the defaults for CSV: comma -,- for columns delimiter and line breaks -\n- for row delimiter):

		````JavaScript
		"typeProperties": {
			"folderPath": "processeddata/structuredlogs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
			"partitionedBy": 
				[
					 { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
					 { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
					 { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }
				],
			"format": {
				"type": "TextFormat"
			}
		},
		````

 1. Daily availability:

		````JavaScript
		"availability": {
			"frequency": "Day",
			"interval": 1
		}
		````

 1. Make sure the final _WebsiteActivityBlob_ dataset looks like the following snippet:
 
		````JavaScript
		{
			"name": "WebsiteActivityBlob",
			"properties": {
				"type": "AzureBlob",
				"linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				"structure": [

					"format": {
						"type": "TextFormat"
					}
				},
				"availability": {
					"frequency": "Day",
					"interval": 1
				}
			}
		}
		````

 1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to deploy the dataset.

 1. (Optional) Finally, let's create a raw and structured dataset for the Product Catalog data. Following the steps laid out in the previous steps, our dataset should look as follows. Do not forget to mark this dataset as external.
 	
>**Note:** This step is optional since we've already added the Product Catalog data to the SQL DW database. 
 		````JavaScript
		{
			"name": "RawProductCatalogBlob",
			"properties": {
				"type": "AzureBlob",
				"linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				"typeProperties": {
					"folderPath": "partsunlimited/productcatalog",
					"format": {
						"type": "JsonFormat"
					}
				},
				"availability": {
					"frequency": "Day",
					"interval": 1
				}
				"external": true
			}
		}
		````

 1. Here's what the Structured Dataset would look like.

	````JavaScript
		{
			"name": "StructuredProductCatalogBlob",
			"properties": {
				"type": "AzureBlob",
				"linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",

					"format": {
						"type": "TextFormat"
					}
				},
				"availability": {
					"frequency": "Day",
					"interval": 1
				}
			}
		}
	````

1. Create the dataset for the SQL Data Warehouse output using the same structure:

 1. In the Editor for the Data Factory, click **New dataset** button on the toolbar and click **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** from the drop down menu.
 1. Set the **name** to "WebsiteActivitySQL" and the **linkedServiceName** to "AzureSqlDWLinkedService"
 1. Use the same structure as the previous dataset:

		````JavaScript
		"structure": [
			{
				"name": "EventDate",
				"type": "Int32"
			},
			{
				"name": "UserId",
				"type": "String"
			},
			{

				"type": "String"
			},
			{
				"name": "ProductId",
				"type": "String"
			},
			{
				"name": "Quantity",
				"type": "Int32"
			},
			{
				"name": "Price",
				"type": "Double"
			}
		],
		````

 1. Set the **tableName** property to **adw.FactProductLog**:

		````JavaScript
		"typeProperties": {
			"tableName": "adw.FactWebsiteActivity"
		},
		````

 1. Daily availability:

		````JavaScript
		"availability": {
			"frequency": "Day",
			"interval": 1
		}
		````

 1. Make sure the final _WebsiteActivitySQL_ dataset looks like the following snippet:

				},
				"availability": {
					"frequency": "Day",
					"interval": 1
				}
			}
		}
		````

 1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to deploy the dataset.


 1. Let's also create a SQL DW dataset for the Product Catalog table. Following the steps from the previous datasets, the JSON should look as follows:
>**NOTE**: Using the 'Clone' option for the ADF JSON helps speed up the process.
 
	````JavaScript

Now you finished creating the input/output datasets and the associated linked services for the pipelines of the Data Factory. In the upcoming exercises you will create the pipelines using the datasets and linked services you just created.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
### Exercise 4: **Orchestrating Azure Data Factory workflow** ###

**Azure Data Factory** enables you to compose data movement and data processing tasks as a data driven workflow. In this exercise, you'll learn how to build your first pipeline that uses HDInsight to transform and analyze the logs from the Parts Unlimited web site.

<a name="Ex4Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Create the pipeline that will run the Hive activity ####

In this task, you'll create the pipeline to generate the stats output using a _HDInsight Hive activity_.  This output will be processed to Azure Data Warehouse in the next task.  Data is processed in a pipeline.  A **Pipeline** is a logical grouping of Activities. They are used to group activities into a unit that performs a task.

**Activities** define the actions to perform on your data. Each activity takes zero or more datasets as inputs and produces one or more datasets as output. An activity is a unit of orchestration in Azure Data Factory.

An _HDInsight Hive activity_ executes Hive queries on a _HDInsight_ cluster.


1. Go back to the Azure Portal and open the **Data Factory**.

1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New dataset** button on the toolbar and select **Azure Blob Storage**. We will create a dummy dataset for the Hive activity that runs the addpartitions.hql script that does not requires any input/output dataset in the data factory.

1. Update the dataset JSON to the following snippet and click **Deploy** to create the dummy dataset. We will use this dummy dataset to perform partition creation in HiveQL.

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "DummyDataset",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureBlob",
			  "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"folderPath": "dummy",
					"format": {
						 "type": "TextFormat"
					}
			  },
			  "availability": {
					"frequency": "Day",
					"interval": 1
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New pipeline** button on the toolbar (click ellipsis button if you don't see the New pipeline button).

1. Change the **name** to "JsonLogsToTabularPipeline" and set the description to "Create tabular data using Hive".

1. Set the **start** date to be 3 days before the current date (for instance: "2016-10-16T00:00:00Z").

1. Set the **end** date to be tomorrow (for instance: "2016-10-20T00:00:00Z").

1. Add a Hive activity to run the "addpartitions.hql" script located in the storage at "partsunlimited\Scripts\addpartitions.hql" and pass the slice date components as parameters. Make sure to replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** placeholder with the storage account name:

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			 "name": "CreatePartitionHiveActivity",
			 "type": "HDInsightHive",
			 "linkedServiceName": "HDInsightLinkedService",
			 "typeProperties": {
				  "scriptPath": "partsunlimited\\Scripts\\addpartitions.hql",
				  "scriptLinkedService": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				  "defines": {
				      "StorageAccountName": "<StorageAccountName>",
				      "Year": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', SliceStart)",
				      "Month": "$$Text.Format('{0:MM}', SliceStart)",
				      "Day": "$$Text.Format('{0:dd}', SliceStart)"
				  }
			 },
			 "inputs": [
				{ "name": "RawJsonData" }
			 ],
			 "outputs": [
				{ "name": "DummyDataset" }
			 ],
			 "scheduler": {
				  "frequency": "Day",
				  "interval": 1
			 }
		}
	],
	````

	This activity will run the **addpartitions.hql** script to create the date partition corresponding to the current slice.

1. Add another Hive activity to run the "structuredlogs.hql" script located in the storage at "partsunlimited\Scripts\structuredlogs.hql" and pass the slice date components as parameters:

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			 //...
		},
		{
			 "name": "ProcessDataHiveActivity",
			 "type": "HDInsightHive",
			 "linkedServiceName": "HDInsightLinkedService",
			 "typeProperties": {
				  "scriptPath": "partsunlimited\\Scripts\\structuredlogs.hql",
				  "scriptLinkedService": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				  "defines": {
				      "Year": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', SliceStart)",
				      "Month": "$$Text.Format('{0:MM}', SliceStart)",
				      "Day": "$$Text.Format('{0:dd}', SliceStart)"
				  }
			 },
			 "inputs": [
				  { "name": "DummyDataset" }
			 ],
			 "outputs": [
				  { "name": "WebsiteActivityBlob" }
			 ],
			 "scheduler": {
				  "frequency": "Day",
				  "interval": 1
			 }
		}
	],
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the pipeline.


1. (Optional) Finally, let's also create a pipeline to move our product catalog data.



<a name="Ex4Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Create a new pipeline to move the HDI output to SQL Data Warehouse ####

In this task, you'll create a new pipeline to move the Hive activity output (stored in a blob) to the SQL Data Warehouse database so it can be consumed using Power BI in the next exercise.

1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New pipeline** button on the toolbar (click ellipsis button if you don't see the New pipeline button).

1. Change the **name** to "LogsToDWPipeline" and set the description to "Move blob data to SQL Data Warehouse".

1. Set the **start** date to be 2 days before the current date.

1. Set the **end** date to be tomorrow.

1. (Optional) Let's first create a Copy activity to move the Product Catalog data from Blob Storage to SQL DW. 
	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			"type": "Copy",
			"name": "ProductCatalogToDWActivity",
			"typeProperties": {
				"source": {
					"type": "BlobSource"
				},
				"sink": {
					"type": "SqlDWSink"	
				}
			},
			"inputs": [
				{
					"name": "WebsiteActivityBlob"
				}
			],
			"outputs": [
				{
					"name": "StructuredProductCatalogSQL"
				}
			],
			"scheduler": {
				"frequency": "Day",
				"interval": 1
			}
		}
	]
	
	````

1. Add a Move activity to move the generated tabular blobs to the SQL Data Warehouse.

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			"type": "Copy",
			"name": "HiveToDWActivity",
			"typeProperties": {
				"source": {
					"type": "BlobSource"
				},
				"sink": {
					"type": "SqlDWSink",
					"sqlWriterStoredProcedureName": "adw.asp_populate_ProfitableProducts"
				}
			},
			"inputs": [
				{
					"name": "WebsiteActivityBlob"
				},
				{
					"name": "StructuredProductCatalogSQL"
				}
			],
			"outputs": [
				{
					"name": "WebsiteActivitySQL"
				}
			],
			"scheduler": {
				"frequency": "Day",
				"interval": 1
			}
		}
	]
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the pipeline.

1. In the Data Factory blade, click **Diagram**, you'll see how the parts were connected and the details.

	![Updated diagram](Images/ex3task2-diagram.png?raw=true "Updated diagram")

	_Updated diagram_

    You can zoom in, zoom out, zoom to 100%, zoom to fit, automatically position pipelines and tables, and show lineage information (highlights upstream and downstream items of selected items). You can double-click an object (input/output table or pipeline) to see its properties.

<a name="Ex4Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 - Monitoring the Data Factory ####

With the Monitoring and Managing app you can easily monitor and manage your data factory pipelines, this app:

- Presents information in a simple way and provide powerful insights into your pipelines.
- Improves navigation and debug ability of pipelines in the data factory by enabling different views of the data factory.
- Enables batch actions in data factory to improve developer productivity.
- Allows you to create and enable email notifications on various events with simple steps (ex. failure).

In this task, you'll explore the features of the Monitoring App using the data factory you created.

1. In the _Summary_ section of the Data Factory blade, click on **Monitoring App** to launch the monitoring app in a new tab.

	![Open Monitoring App](Images/ex3task3-open-monitoring-app.png?raw=true "Open Monitoring App")

		````JavaScript
		"typeProperties": {
			"tableName": "adw.ProfitableProducts"
		},
		````

 1. Daily availability:

		````JavaScript
		"availability": {
			"frequency": "Day",
			"interval": 1
		}
		````

 1. Make sure the final _ProfitableProductSP_ dataset looks like the following snippet:
 
		````JavaScript
		{
			 "name": "ProfitableProductsSQL",
			 "properties": {
				  "published": false,
				  "type": "AzureSqlDWTable",
				  "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",
				  "typeProperties": {
						"tableName": "adw.ProfitableProducts"

 1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New pipeline** button on the toolbar (click ellipsis button if you don't see the New pipeline button).
 1. Change the **name** to "PopulateProductStatsPipeline" and set the description to "Run stored procedure to populate product stats".
 1. Set the **start** date to be 2 days before the current date.
 1. Set the **end** date to be tomorrow.
 1. Add a _SqlServerStoredProcedure_ activity to to run the **sp_populate_stats** stored procedure from the SQL Data Warehouse. Make sure to replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** placeholder with the storage account name:

		````JavaScript
		"activities": [
			{
				 "type": "SqlServerStoredProcedure",
				 "typeProperties": {
					  "storedProcedureName": "adw.asp_populate_ProfitableProducts"
				 },
				 "inputs":[
					{
