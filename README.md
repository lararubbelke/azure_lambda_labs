# Azure Data Labs - For ISVs#

There are 3 Modules as a part of this lab

1. Intelligent Apps: This lab will help you understand some of the tools and services available to work with your near-real time data and get insights to help make your apps intelligent.

1. Gain Insights: With each data scenario, comes a data pipeline. This module will help you understand how to build out a robust data pipeline using Azure PaaS services such as HDInsight, SQL Data Warehouse & Data Factory.

1. Security: Every multi-tenant app requires some basic security measures such as RLS and encryption. In this module, we dive into security best practices with data services in Azure.


We will be using a dummy use case of an e-commerce store and generating click-stream data based on user's activity on the website.
